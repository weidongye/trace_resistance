# trace_resistance
example program to trace a net to receivers to find the path of least resistance


I ran with python 2.7 and was able to get reasonable output for path of least resistance:

final reciever dictionary:
{'rcvr2': 12, 'rcvr3': 17, 'rcvr1': 7}

path of least resistance:
smallest resistance driver is:rcvr1 with resistance value of:7
